        <h1 class="col-lg-6">Racine Carrée:<br> Album Redesign</h1>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p>I redesigned the album cover art for "racine carrée", the second album by Belgian artist Stromae. Using the album cover as a base, I built a visual system for an imagined tour and applied it to a poster, merch, and graphics for Spotify.</p>
            <p></p>
        </div>

    <div class="m-5 row">
        <div class="col-lg-8">
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Racine carrée (English: square root) is the second album by Belgian artist Paul Van Haver who is best known by his stage name, Stromae. After releasing racine carrée in 2013 to worldwide acclaim, Stromae took a long hiatus from music. In his songs, he discusses themes such as race, gender, climate change, terminal illness, mental health, and parenthood.</p>
            <p>I first fell in love with his music when my French teacher played his songs during class. Despite being unfamiliar with the language, I felt like I could understand what he was saying through his musicality and emotion alone. When I was examing the album, I felt a disconnect between the uptempo experimental music and the calm and restrained cover.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4">

    </div>


    <div class="m-5">
        <h2>Research & Inspiration</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The designers of the original album cover was a Belgian design duo called Boldatwork. I examined the decisions that went into their designs and studied their influences. 
            Stromae had commissioned them to develop a different pattern for each song on the album, which could be subsequently made into clothing. Each pattern reflected the lyrics as well as the specific musical influences of each song. I also
            found out that Stromae had always used Century Gothic as the main typeface in his work. Years ago, he even asked Boldatwork to develop a new, "impossible" version based on the 
            original font.
        </p>
        <br>
            <div class="row">
                <img src="images/stromae/regularFont.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid col-lg-4">
                <img src="images/stromae/outlineFont.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid col-lg-4">
                <img src="images/stromae/tousMemes.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid col-lg-4">
            </div>
        <br>
        <p>I thought these impossible versions were fantastic and full of character, but I also thought they weren't utilized in the most effective way. A lot of their detail gets lost at smaller sizes, as seen 
            in the example above. In addition to the impossible typefaces, Stromae's creative agency, Mosaert, also has a custom typeface based on Century Gothic called Century Mosaert 2020. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>M.C. Escher</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I derived all my shapes and forms from the works of M.C. Escher. Stromae's clothing line, Mosaert, includes tesselations and geometric forms stated to be inspired by Escher. As I
            was staring at "Relativity" one day, it occured to me that the shape of the stairs looked somewhat like a square root symbol. This first comparison would soon
            become the basis for my entire project.

            <p class="col-lg-8">I listened to all of the songs on the album and wrote down my thoughts about each one in a mind map.
                Most of the lyrics are written from the perspective of someone who feels pessimistic about the state of 
                the world. They try to disguise their hopelessness by using anger and apathy as a mask, but their true
                feelings remain clear as day. 
                <br><br>
                I asked myself, how could I, using visual elements alone, convey the feeling of being trapped in the pitfalls and drudgery of everyday life?

        <div class="row">
            <p class="col-lg-6">I created another version of the album cover to be displayed on different music streaming platforms.
                The physical redesigned album cover is reliant on its three-dimensional aspect and without the ability to display the back or the slip jacket
                I felt like a lot of the storytelling aspects would be lost. So instead, I chose to omit the storytelling entirely
                and just let the viewer focus on the impossible forms of the environment.
                <br>
                <br>
                As for the banner, I simply used a close-up of the image I made with the impossible version of the Century Gothic typeface that Stromae
                commissioned from the original album designers.

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p>Making the tour poster was one of my favourite parts about this project. To go over some of its elements...</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Text</h4>
                <p>The title translates to "The European Tour", and the large text at the bottom reads "The 8th Anniversary".
                    As this is for a European concert, the dates are written in the date/month/year format instead of the American
                    month/date/year format.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Möbius Strip</h4>
                <p>Continuing with the themes of infinity from the album cover, I utilized a möbius strip as the main visual graphic, which I 
                    first learned about from M.C. Escher's archive of works. A möbius strip is a surface wiht only one side and only one
                    boundary curve. If its full length were crawled by an ant, the ant would return to its starting point having traversed
                    all sides without ever crossing an edge.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Orbs</h4>
                <p>I reused the orb from the back of the redesigned album cover. I thought that they added a sense of otherworldliness to the strip
                    and that they neatly helped to keep the poster and the cover cohesive.
                </p>

        </div>

        <h3>Polos</h3>
        <p>Fun fact about Stromae, he's somewhat of a fashion icon. His brand, Mosaert, releases a limited number of clothing items every year in a capsule collection.
            I thought it was only appropriate that for the tour merch, I include some shirts, specifically polo shirts because Stromae likes to use traditional
            English garments and decorate them with Dutch wax patterns. I didn't use Dutch wax as an inspiration, but I definitely took cues from Mosaert's older
            capsules which feature similar geometric patterns.
        </p>
        <div class="row">

        </div>

        <h2>Final Takeaways</h2>
        <p>I was quite intimidated by this project at the beginning. The more research I conducted, the less confident I was that I could make
            an album cover that would match up to the quality of the original. I was so determined to create something that would effortlessly
            blend in to Stromae's branding from this period that I didn't stop to consider what would happen if I just allowed myself to showcase 
            my own unique style and perspective. Once I realized that I had placed an unnecessary restriction upon myself, I was able to relax and
            start from scratch without adding too much stress upon myself.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>OH! One Last Thing!</h3>
        <p>When I began this project, Stromae hadn't released any new music since 2013 except for one single called "Défiler".
            He had taken an indefinite hiatus from the music industry and many of his fans, including me, thought he would never release more music again.
            Well... guess what? On October 15, 2021, one week before I finished this project, Stromae released a new single called "Santé", <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3QS83ubhHE" style="color: #FF21D8; text-decoration: underline;">out now on YouTube</a>.
            I'm not saying I had anything to do with it, but, who knows? 😳 I'm just glad I get to hear his voice again. 😊
