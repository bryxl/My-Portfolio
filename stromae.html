        <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p>I redesigned the album cover art for "racine carrÃ©e", the second album by Belgian artist Stromae. Using the album cover as a base, I built a visual system for an imagined tour and applied it to a poster, merch, and graphics for Spotify.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Racine carrÃ©e (English: square root) is the second album by Belgian artist Paul Van Haver who is best known by his stage name, Stromae. After releasing racine carrÃ©e in 2013 to worldwide acclaim, Stromae took a long hiatus from music. In his songs, he discusses themes such as race, gender, climate change, terminal illness, mental health, and parenthood.</p>
            <p>I first fell in love with his music when my French teacher played his songs during class. Despite being unfamiliar with the language, I felt like I could understand what he was saying through his musicality and emotion alone. When I was examing the album, I felt a disconnect between the uptempo experimental music and the calm and restrained cover.</p>

            <p class="col-lg-6">I created another version of the album cover to be displayed on different music streaming platforms.
                The physical redesigned album cover is reliant on its three-dimensional aspect and without the ability to display the back or the slip jacket
                I felt like a lot of the storytelling aspects would be lost. So instead, I chose to omit the storytelling entirely
                and just let the viewer focus on the impossible forms of the environment.
                <br>
                <br>
                As for the banner, I simply used a close-up of the image I made with the impossible version of the Century Gothic typeface that Stromae
                commissioned from the original album designers.

        <p>Fun fact about Stromae, he's somewhat of a fashion icon.</p>

        <h2>Final Takeaways</h2>
        <p>I was quite intimidated by this project at the beginning. The more research I conducted, the less confident I was that I could make
            an album cover that would match up to the quality of the original. I was so determined to create something that would effortlessly
            blend in to Stromae's branding from this period that I didn't stop to consider what would happen if I just allowed myself to showcase 
            my own unique style and perspective. Once I realized that I had placed an unnecessary restriction upon myself, I finally felt free enough
            to 
        </p>
        <h3>OH! One Last Thing!</h3>
        <p>When I began this project, Stromae hadn't released any new music since 2013 except for one single called "DÃ©filer".
            He had taken an indefinite hiatus from the music industry and many of his fans, including me, thought he would never release more music again.
            Well... guess what? On October 15, 2021, one week before I finished this project, Stromae released a new single called "SantÃ©", <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3QS83ubhHE" style="color: #FF21D8; text-decoration: underline;">out now on YouTube</a>.
            I'm not saying I had anything to do with it, but, who knows? ðŸ˜³ I'm just glad I get to hear his voice again. ðŸ˜Š
